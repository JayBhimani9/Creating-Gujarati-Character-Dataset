# Creating-Gujarati-Character-Dataset
This project contain is use to create near human Gujarati character dataset which has around 385 characters of gujarati language.

# Training Dataset

For the training dataset, it is available on Kaggle on my friends id

## Problem statement 

The scarcity of high-quality Gujarati character datasets poses significant challenges for the development of effective machine learning models, especially in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems and other language processing tasks. While advanced OCR systems have been developed for widely spoken languages like English, Hindi, and Chinese, the availability of such systems for regional languages like Gujarati remains limited due to the lack of adequate datasets.

## How to use?

-> First, download the dataset from Kaggle.
-> After the run, the GAN-mp file for creating new images for all 385 characters of the Gujarati language. 
-> After that, for result comparison, we have used the vision transformer.
